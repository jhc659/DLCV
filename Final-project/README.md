# DLCV Final Project ( 3D ScanNet200 long-tail segmentation )

# How to run code
## Installation
We provide a simple bash file to install the environment:
```
git clone https://github.com/jhc659/DLCV.git
cd DLCV/Final-project
source install.sh
```
Cuda-11.3 is required. Modify `install.sh` if different cuda version is used. See [Install](https://github.com/guochengqian/PointNeXt/blob/master/docs/index.md) for details.

## Setup
```shell script=
bash setup.sh $1
```
* **$1** is the path to the folder of dataset (e.g. \*/dataset/)
    which contains training data folder and testing data folder
    (e.g. \*/dataset/train/\*.ply, \*/dataset/test/\*.ply)

That is, a valid dataset is as below:
```
├── $1
│   ├── train
│   │   ├── *.ply
│   ├── test
│   │   ├── *.ply
```

After running the script, the directory tree containing preprocessed data will look like this (it will be saved to the current working directory):

```
├── dataset_preprocessed
│   ├── train
│   │   ├── *.pth
│   ├── val
│   │   ├── *.pth
│   ├── test
│   │   ├── *.pth
```

    
## Train
```shell script=
bash train.sh
```
* For all the training configurations, please refer to the config file. The file is located at `PointMetaBase/cfgs/scannet_{loss}`, where `loss` can be replaced by either `CE` (cross entropy) or `Focal`, depending on the training scheme that is being used.
* The model checkpoints will be saved to `log/scannet_{loss}` by default.
## Inference
```shell script=
bash inference.sh $1
```
* **$1** is the path to the output directory (e.g. \*/output)
* The script uses checkpoint `best.pth` by default, modify the path if any other checkpoint is to be used.
